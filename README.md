and government agencies to digitize their archives.
Education
Teachers and students can convert scanned study notes, textbooks and lecture notes into text for better 
exam preparation. Scanned lectures takes a lot of space on your hard drive or phone. The text-based 
version, created via image to text converter takes up much less space.

Book digitization is the process of converting physical books, magazines and other records into digital 
media using an image to text converter. As content digitizes, more and more publishers and 
organizations are digitizing their physical books into text formats such as PDF/A for easy distribution 
and reproduction in the online space. These digitized books can then be read on a digital screen. The 
editable format helps reduce file size and allows third-party applications to search, reformat, or 
manipulate text.
